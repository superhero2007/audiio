  <p>All through my city, all through my home. All the way from Memphis, Tennessee. Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop. And he's got something special for y'all tonight. We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone. Girl, I find you so amazing. And under the lights when everything goes. If I could just find a way. I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh. You should know that. And still find time for us too, yeah. She deserves a crown. Seems so long ago you walked away. All those things I shouldn't do. I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
  </p><p>
    Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance. 'Cuz you are my star. Ohh, yeah, yeah. Am I good enough for you?. How would you like to fly?. Beautiful days are long gone. Senorita, I feel for you. Am I strong enough to maintain this love?. So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine. But you could feel this real love. Running fast in my mind. Such a beautiful girl. He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl. Was it something I said to make you turn away?. Could I be that man that can keep you happy?</p>
